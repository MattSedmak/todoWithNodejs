# A todo list built with nodejs/express.

This is the first assignment for the course 'Dynamic Web Development' which I am currently studying at Medieinstitutet. It is a CRUD todo list application. 


## Installation
- clone repo.
- npm install. 
- Create a .env file, add PORT and your connection string to mongodb using "DB_CONNECT" as variable.
- npm start. (If Nodemon is installed).


## The assignment brief was:
- create a todo list with node js & Express, Mongodb & Mongoose and EJS.
- All the todo tasks should be saved in a Mongodb database.
- The user should be able to add, edit, delete and read tasks.
- Database connection info should be stored in a separate config file, and not pushed to GIT.
- Views, Models and Routes should be saved in separated folders.
- Pagination.
- The user should be able to sort tasks by date.
- The project should be saved to Github.

All points in the brief were completed.
